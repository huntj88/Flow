======================

#Advantages

compile time transition and input/output validation

Simpler api, replaced by visual representation of your flow,
very easy to iterate on a flow controller in development

handles android lifecycle better

api for defining custom Flow Groups, which sets up the UI each flow in the group will live in.
(for things like view pagers)
